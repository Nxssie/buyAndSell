# BuyAndSell :car:

BuyAndSell is just a simple hybrid CRUD application to buy and sell cars.

## Installation :wrench:

Clone this repo and instantly you will get the backend and the frontend ready to deploy in few steps.

1. Go to [backend](https://github.com/Nxssie/buyAndSell/tree/master/backend) folder and you will find the sql script, just run it over your DBMS.
    * Obviously you need to run the database service to follow
2. Once previous step is done, you can run the backend as a Spring Boot App.
3. If you have your backend running (in a normal situation you'll get it), now run
```bash
ionic serve
```

* Add --lab tag if you want to try Ionic Lab environment.

## Advices :exclamation:

* This app works better in smaller devices because its UI design. <br>
* This is just a project. Who knows about the future. But now I'm interested in learning other things. <br>
* There is a Login/Register system that is all manually coded without security premises. It means it can work in a weird way depending on the page and its implementation.

## Built (frameworks and tools) :fire:
Frontend 
* Ionic5
    * Angular
* VSCode

Backend
* Spring
* Xampp w/ MariaDB (just a personal preference over Oracle's MySQL service)
